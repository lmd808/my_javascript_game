// goal is to make a game where people can guess words by hitting keys on a keyboard
// Ineed to log wins, losses and guess on my page
// i would like to be able to reset the game each time after a win
// maybe i'd like to figure out how to have the enter button reset the page

//things I'll need for my game
// make a variable for an array of words that I want people to guess

// var words = ['an array'];

// you can't guess or type an array so I will probably need to make the words in the away into strings

// I need to make the words called random

// i want to make blank spaces for the selected word on screen they'll be placeholder

// i want to give my wins losses and guesses and guesses left  a value
// it should probably be  # # [] #

// game play function

// pressing any key will start the game
// a random word will be loaded from my words array
// the word will go through a function that splits it up and then converts my little arrays into strings that can be called by my key strokes
// the letters wont show in the blanks unless i click it so I'll make the new strings rest in the blanks
// this will work because people can type strings and my blanks (i'll make a variable for them) will be set equal to a string. blanks + new strings = blanks

// build something so that if the win

// wins ++ x 1

// if lose

// losess ++ x 1
// make a function for guesses used
// if the guess is wrong the guesses-- x 1
// we'll start with 9 guesses 10 in all

// make a function for keystrokes
// if the keystrokes don't match what's in the word put them into the players guesses string or array ... don't know what will work

// check my game play accuracy (are the words right)
//should i convert the strings back to an array to compae to the selected random word?
// don't know yet

// reset function

// key up event handler
